# Hackintosh-build-Monterey
This is my own hackintosh build for macos monterey

This includes the efi folder for the boot. Paste your dmg recovery file onto com.apple.... folder. Mine is monterey 12.6.1 use same version if you want. Also upgrading to ventura didn't tried that you can do that with your own risk. Be sure to match the spec of this process.

# My PC spec:
cpu: Ryzen 3 3300x
// gpu: AMD RX 570 8gb
// motherboard: MSI b450 mortar max
// ram: 16gb dual channel ddr4 3200mhz corsair
// ssd: sata 3 120gb wd green, 240gb m.2 for windows and 1tb hdd

Note: For my use case microphone doesn't work but works with asrock b450 motherboard because the efi was made by the asrock motherboard user mainly with similar spec.
